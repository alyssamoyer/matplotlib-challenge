# Trends

There were two drugs that had significantly higher mouse survival rates. Mice taking Ramicane and Capomulin were 20% more likely to survive after 40 days than all other drugs. 

The two drugs with the highest survival rate (Ramicane and Capomulin) have the slowest metastatic spread and the lowest tumor volume. While the tumor volume with these two drugs decreased significantly there was still an increase in the number of metastatic sites.

Propriva had the fastest declining survival rate during the first 40 days with less than 30% of the mice surviving in the end. Surprisingly Propriva did not have the high rate of metastatic spread or tumor volume in the first 40 days.
